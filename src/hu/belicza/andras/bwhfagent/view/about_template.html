<p>%APPLICATION_NAME% is a java utility program that runs in the background and automatically checks the last replays of Starcraft for hacks. It can be used as a launcher too.</p>

<p>You can also run a check on any of your saved replays or on entire folders of replays (no BWChart required). It logs the results and if it finds a hacker in your last replay, it can bring its window to front or play an alert sound.</p>

<p>For those who possess a valid authorization key can report hackers automatically to a central hacker database.</p>

<p>You can read more about what these keys are and how to get one: <a href='http://code.google.com/p/bwhf/wiki/AuthorizationKeys' target='_blank'>AuthorizationKeys</a></p>

<p>You can list, search, filter, sort existing hackers online on this web page: <a href='%BWHF_HACKER_DATA_BASE_SERVER_URL%' target='_blank'>BWHF Hacker data base</a></p>

<p>You can read the version history and changes, and what new additions/changes/features will be available in the next version here: <a href='http://code.google.com/p/bwhf/wiki/VersionHistory' target='_blank'>VersionHistory</a></p>

<p><b>Pros compared to other launchers and detectors:</b>
<ul>
	<li><b>This is not a 3rd party program!</b> It does not modify Starcraft's memory and it does not interfere with Starcraft in any way so there is <b>absolutely no risk</b> of getting banned by Blizzard or any battle.net server for using it.
	<li>Since it does not modify Starcraft's memory, it does not add new bugs and does not cause Starcraft to crash.
	<li>It's a standalone program not some kind of dll or bw plugin, so you can use it ANYWHERE (iccup, normal battle.net servers, LAN w/e) with or without any launcher. BWHF Agent is a launcher itself.
	<li>You can start and close it at anytime (before or after starting Starcraft, before of after logging in to battle.net, before or during a game).
	<li>It does not belong to a specific Starcraft version therefore it works after Starcraft updates without modification.
	<li>You can repeat the scan process after game, and you can scan old replays.
	<li>You can scan recursively entire folders of replays.
	<li>Does not require Starcraft or any other programs (like BWChart) to be running or even being installed.
	<li>It can report hackers automatically to a central hacker database.
	<li>It's open source therefore the risk of being/containing a malware/adware/virus is minimized (if you always download it from its original home page).
</ul></p>

<p><b>Cons:</b>
<ul>
	<li>Scan runs after games (it won't tell you if someone's hacking during the game).
</ul></p>
