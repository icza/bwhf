# How to prevent getting hacked? #

If you don't want to meet hackers on battle.net, do the following things:
  1. First of all, download and use the latest version of BWHF Agent.
  1. Be sure you keep the gateway on the autoscan tab synchronized to the one you play on.
  1. Before game starts, always use the Player checker function of BWHF Agent: press the Print Screen key on your keyboard to check the players in the game lobby. If BWHF Agent alerts for hackers, either ban them or leave the game.
  1. Check the records of the players in the game lobby. If you see small accounts like 5-4-0, don't play with them. New accounts mostly just want to hack. Every decent player who doesn't hack has an account with at least a few hundred games on it (if you don't then start building one... sorry folks who just visit another gateway with a new account). If someone with a big record hacks, he/she eventually will end up in the hacker database, and you can filter them out with the Player checker feature.
  1. Also avoid suspicious records with surreal win ratio like 100-5-0 and surreal disconnect ratio like 54-23-32.
  1. Type `"/whereis name"` or `"/whois name"` to check if the player is online and if he/she is in the same game with you. If not, you can be sure he is a hacker spoofing a name. Ban him or leave the game (don't mistake similar letters like the small L and capital i, the letter O with the number zero etc.).
  1. If certain rules apply to a username, that also means he is probably a hacker and you should have no reason to play with him. First rule: if you see a random meaningless name, don't play with him. For example: "pofahiqwefkla" or "987314523". Second rule: if the username contains the word hacker in any form, then he is a hacker (a normal, legit player would never name himself like that). For example: "i\_hack", "i\_never\_hack", "h6x0r", "i\_dr0hax\_u".

If you follow these steps, you can filter out **more than 95 %** of the hackers.
