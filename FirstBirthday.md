**This is how the first Agent (ver. 0.99) looked like:**

The first Agent only supported Windows. Since then another **16 new releases** have been launched adding [many features](Features.md), detecting more and more hacks, making the Agent more user friendly, stable and accurate. One of the most anticipated feature to scan and alert for previously reported hackers before game (in the game lobby) was added on April 24, 2009 in version 2.20. The newest Agent now supports all 3 major operating systems: Windows, Linux and MAC OS-X.

**This is how the Agent (ver. 2.90) currently looks like:**

From the original replay scanner and central hacker database project BWHF grew to a complete Starcraft Broodwar utility program and to a global system of Starcraft Broodwar games and players.

The global network of Starcraft games and players has been initiated on June 29, 2009 with the Agent version of 2.40. It provides statistical information of Starcraft games and players from all around the world. It's like a Starcraft "Facebook". This network is built automatically by the BWHF Agents. You can also add any of your saved replays which is recommended for a more complete network.

**Here are the 1<sup>st</sup>-year statistics of the BWHF system:**
  * More than **31,000 hackers** reported
  * More than **64,000 hacker reports**
  * More than **550,000 players** registered in the Players' Network
  * More than **1,000,000 games** added to the Players' Network

The initial USEast autarchy amongst the hackers (which was over 90%) is now broken and USEast holds less than 50% of the reported hackers.

**BWHF presentation:**

I've found a YouTube video which is a Starcraft FPVOD. The guy who made it is a BWHF user, and he gives a good look at what BWHF is and how it works by talking about it during the game.
