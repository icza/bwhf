# BWHF Online Hacker Database #



The BWHF online hacker database is available here:

http://bwhf.net/hackerdb/hackers

On that page you can list, search, filter, sort existing hackers. The hackers are listed in colors to easily associate with their gateways (which is also displayed). The following colors are used for gateways:
| **Gateway:** | **Color:** |
|:-------------|:-----------|
|USEast|Red <font color='#ff5050'>Red</font>|
|USWest|Aqua <font color='#00ffff'>Aqua</font>|
|Europe|Green <font color='#00ff00'>Green</font>|
|Asia|Yellow <font color='#ffff00'>Yellow</font>|
|iCCup|Black <font color='#000000'>Black</font>|
|Other|Purple <font color='#f080f0'>Purple</font>|

Clicking on the name of a hacker (if it is a link) will show the player's profile on the BWHF Players' Network. Clicking on the reports count will list the reports of the hacker with some additional details. If more details are available from the games of the reports, an additional details link will be available (which points to the proper game detail page of the BWHF Players' Network.

## Filtering ##

You can filter the hackers with various properties. Only reports matching all the filters will be counted and displayed.

A report/hacker will be counted if:
  * **Hacker name:** the hacker name contains this lowercased text
  * **Gateways:** the hacker belongs to one of the selected gateways
  * **Game engines:** the replay of the report has been played with one of the selected game engines
  * **Map name:** the map of the replay of the report contains this lowercased text
  * **Min report count:** the hacker has received at least reports of this count
  * **Reported with key:** the report was done using this key; you can use this to list your own reports/hackers

## Sorting ##

You can sort the results by clicking on the header of the column you want to sort by. Clicking on the same column again will change the sort order (reverse it).

The columns and their meaning:
  * **#:** the ordinal of the hacker in the current sorting
  * **Name:** the name of the hacker
  * **Gateway:** the gatway of the hacker
  * **Report count:** the number of reports of the hacker
  * **Hacking period:** the tract of time while the BWHF system knows about the hacker (the number of days between the hacker's first and last reports)
  * **First reported:** the date and time of when the first report of the hacker arrived; this has the meaning of how long has been the hacker hacking, or rather when was he first recorded in the database
  * **Last reported:** the date and time of when the last report of the hacker arrived; this has the meaning of when was the last activity of the hacker, or rather when was he last recorded

Note that all times and dates between 2009-09-18 and 2009-10-21 are in GMT-9. Other reports are in the time zone of GMT+1.

The **First reported** column shows how long the hacker is using hacks and the **Last reported** column shows how recently was the hacker active (based on the reports arrived to the BWHF system).

The numbers in the **Report count** column are links. If you click on them, the reports of the hacker will be listed.

The default sorting column is the **Last reported** column, which puts the most recent active hackers to the top of the list. Sorting by the **First reported** column puts the newest hackers to the top of the list (again, based on the reports arrived to the BWHF system).

## Hacker database - Players' Network connection ##
If a hacker is registered in the Players' Network, the hacker name will be displayed as a link. Clicking on this link will take you to the profile page of the player in the Players' Network.

When you're viewing the list of reports of a hacker, if a game of a report is added to the Players' Network, you will see a **Details** link in the **Game details** column. Clicking on this link will take you to the game profile in the Players' Network.
